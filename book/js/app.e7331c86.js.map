<p>1.在vue开发过程中,一些es6的语法并不能完全转换为es5的写法,数组里的include方法,在有些低版本浏览器里是无法运行的.因为webpack并没有将它转为indexOf,所以需要注意.</p>\r\n            <p>2.在火狐等浏览器里面,event事件是存在兼容性的,需要传,所以我们经常这样写. let event = e || event e是传过来的.</p>\r\n            <p>3.img出错的时候,可以这样写'@error'.</p>\r\n            <codes :codes=\"loadImg\"></codes>\r\n            <p>\r\n                这样当图片请求错误就能使用默认的图片了, 欢迎使用自定义指令\r\n                <a href=\"#/Directive\">v-loadimg</a>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>4.打包的时候发现图片路径不对,可以去config里面的配置里看看,是不是build里面的assetsPublicPath问题呢?</p>\r\n            <p>5.有些时候, 比如在详情页里, 最让我头疼的是: 数据是异步的,所以你只能把数据实现全部定义好, 真是麻烦. 定义好了还算可以解决. 但是碰到有些问题,比如我需要一个倒计时,那么我肯定引入一个倒计时组件,那么页面渲染的时候传过去的时间为0(事先定义好的), 然后数据接收到了再更改时间. 但是此时倒计时并不能走. 解决办法是给倒计时组件的div加一个v-if, 时间为0的时候不展示, 等时间获取到了在展示. 完美解决问题.</p>\r\n
